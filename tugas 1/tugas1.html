        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p><span style="font-size: 2em; color: #080808;">s</span>trawberries are sweet, supple red fruits with seed-studded surfaces. They come from a low-growing plant belonging to the genus <em>Fragaria</em> of the rose (<em>Rosaceae</em>) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed foliage, and runners. They originate from the north temperate zones.</p>
        <p>They are one of the most famous and trendiest fruits on the planet. There are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size, and feel, all of which have similar traits: heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yellow seeds, and petite, royal, leafy green lids.</p>

        <h2 id="detailed-history">Detailed History</h2>
        <p>The word strawberry is coined from "strewn" berries about the plants and thus the “strewn berry” finally turned into “strawberry.” They are not actual fruits but distended ends of the stamen of the plant. The seeds are on the external surface rather than the internal berry. Each berry has around 200 seeds. They are low in calories and non-fat, loaded with vitamin C, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6, and potassium.</p>
        <p>Over the years, they have been utilized as medications for ailments like stained teeth, sunburns, gout, and digestion. They were served at medieval state occasions as a symbol of peace and excellence.</p>

        <h2 id="various-uses">Various Uses of Strawberries</h2>
        <p>Strawberries have numerous uses. One of the most famous uses is as an ingredient in the preparation of drinks, meals, or snacks. They are commonly used in cakes, yogurts, desserts, salads, juices, and chocolates.</p>
